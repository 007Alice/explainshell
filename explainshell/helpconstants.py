PIPELINES = textwrap.dedent('''   <b>Pipelines</b>
       A  <u>pipeline</u> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators <b>|</b> or <b>|&amp;</b>.  The
       format for a pipeline is:

              [<b>time</b> [<b>-p</b>]] [ ! ] <u>command</u> [ [<b>|</b>âŽª<b>|&amp;</b>] <u>command2</u> ... ]

       The standard output of <u>command</u> is connected  via  a  pipe  to  the  standard  input  of  <u>command2</u>.   This
       connection  is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see <b>REDIRECTION</b> below).  If <b>|&amp;</b>
       is used, the standard error of <u>command</u> is connected to <u>command2</u>'s standard input through the pipe; it  is
       shorthand  for  <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>  <b>|</b>.   This  implicit  redirection  of  the  standard  error  is  performed after any
       redirections specified by the command.

       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless  the  <b>pipefail</b>  option  is
       enabled.   If  <b>pipefail</b>  is  enabled,  the  pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost)
       command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.  If the reserved  word
       <b>!</b>   precedes  a  pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as
       described above.  The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.

       If the <b>time</b> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as user and system  time  consumed  by
       its execution are reported when the pipeline terminates.  The <b>-p</b> option changes the output format to that
       specified by POSIX.  When the shell is in <u>posix</u> <u>mode</u>, it does not recognize <b>time</b> as a  reserved  word  if
       the  next  token begins with a `-'.  The <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable may be set to a format string that specifies
       how the timing information should be displayed; see the description of <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> under  <b>Shell</b>  <b>Variables</b>
       below.

       When the shell is in <u>posix</u> <u>mode</u>, <b>time</b> may be followed by a newline.  In this case, the shell displays the
       total user and system time consumed by the shell and its children.  The <b>TIMEFORMAT</b> variable may  be  used
       to specify the format of the time information.

       Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a subshell).''')
